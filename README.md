Dataset is from supporting info file of paper:" Modeling and Prediction of Binding Affinities Between the Human
Amphiphysin SH3 Domain and Its Peptide Ligands Using Genetic Algorithm-Gaussian Processes "
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18814309/
I copy the data from word file to an excel file and save it as SPB_dataset.csv 

Pfeature calculation is by the help of @dataprofessor
